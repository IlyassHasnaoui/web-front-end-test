		<p>
			Members of the family Anatidae, ducks are found near fresh or salt water habitats. Most ducks species breed once every year and are monogamous, but the bond between male and female often lasts for only that year. Females lay from 10 to 15 eggs and sit on them for about 28 days before they start to hatch. Ducklings spend about 10 hours in the nest before heading to the water with their mother. This is only one among other features on duckling behavior, survival and biology.
